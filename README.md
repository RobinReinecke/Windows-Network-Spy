# Windows-Network-Spy
C# application to spy local windows machines using wmic.

At insufficient configured networks this programm can spy every windows machine and get the User signed in. This is a big security risk along with some other "windows tricks" which make it possible to access the foreign computer.

I wrote this some times ago. I haven't tested it since.
